A simple two-dimensional nonlinear problem was used to prove the validity of the path-following algorithm.
\begin{mini}
	{x\in\mathbb{R}^2}{p_1x_1^3+x_2^2}{\label{eq:simple}}{}
	\addConstraint{x_2-e^{-x_1}\geq 0}{}
	\addConstraint{x_1\geq p_2}{}
\end{mini}
We start at the approximate solution to Equation\ref{eq:simple}$(x_0,y_0)=((0.5,0.6),1.2)$ with $p=(1,-4)$ and trace a path to generate an approximate solution for $p=(8,1)$.
