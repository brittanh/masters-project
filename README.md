### Norwegian University of Science and Technology (Trondheim, Norway)

Based on work done by Eka Suwartadi: [Implementation of path-following algorithm for LICQ case study](https://github.com/detu/licq-path-following).
Eka's work was utilised throughout this project to create an equivalent but more universal algorithm in Python.

To use the code the following elements are required to be installed:

* Python 2.7
* [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* casadi
* [scikits.odes](https://github.com/bmcage/odes)
	* Read requirements before [install page](https://scikits-odes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)
		* Requires C compiler
		* Fortran compiler (i.e. gfortran)
		* [Sundials 2.7.0](https://computation.llnl.gov/projects/sundials/sundials-software)

## Purpose
This code implements economic NMPC using a path-following algorithm.
## Getting Started
The scripts work as follows:

## Distillation Column Model ##

The distillation column model used was developed by Sigurd Skogestad and is referred to as "Column A".

Details of the model and the original files can be found on his [website](http://folk.ntnu.no/skoge/book/matlab_m/cola/cola.html).
